# Automatic-Smart-Irrigation-Management-System-Using-ArduinoUno
This project was designed and developed in my final year. It was built primarily to benefit farmers.
The main board with ATMega 328p microcontroller used here Arduino Uno . It is very useful for small scale , college level automation projects as it is very to program and the interfacing is very convenient.
